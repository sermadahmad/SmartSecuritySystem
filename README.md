📢 Mobile Security Application Using React Native – Project Overview

Hello everyone,
My name is SERMAD AHMAD, and today I’m excited to introduce my final year capstone project – a Mobile Security Application designed to enhance smartphone protection and personal safety.

🔑 What is the Project About?
This project aims to develop a mobile security app using React Native, making it compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The app provides a proactive security mechanism to protect users from mobile theft and unauthorized access. What makes it unique is that it offers a fully customizable security experience tailored to user preferences.

💡 How Does It Work?
The app uses the phone’s sensors to detect when it’s placed idle, for example, on a table. If the phone is picked up and remains locked beyond a user-defined time, the app automatically:

Triggers an alarm with a customizable tone and volume.
Captures photos from both the front and back cameras.
Sends the photos and the current location to a list of emergency contacts selected by the user.
The key point here is that the camera and location services only activate after the trigger, ensuring privacy and conserving battery life.

🚨 Emergency Stop for False Alarms:
To handle false triggers, I’ve added an emergency stop feature. The user can enter a PIN to immediately stop the alarm and prevent notifications from being sent. There’s also a secure method for resetting the PIN if needed.

📊 Security Logs:
Additionally, the app maintains a log of all security events, recording details like timestamps and notification statuses. This helps users review past incidents and monitor their device’s security history.

⚙️ Full Customization:
One of the app’s biggest strengths is that it is fully customizable. Users can adjust:

Trigger time: How long before the security activates.
Alarm settings: Including tone and volume.
Notification preferences: Whether to send location, photos, or both.
PIN settings: For emergency stop or false alarms.
🛡️ Why This App Matters:
Mobile theft and unauthorized access are common issues, and most security apps only protect the device with a lock screen. This app takes security a step further by combining real-time alerts with emergency contact notifications, giving users peace of mind and a tool to safeguard their data and privacy.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
The app is built using:

React Native: For cross-platform development.
Firebase: For real-time notifications.
SQLite: For maintaining security logs.
Device Sensors: Accelerometer for motion detection.
🚀 Future Potential:
In the future, I plan to add features like:

Cloud backup for logs and settings
AI-based intruder detection
Remote control via a companion app
🎯 Conclusion:
In summary, my mobile security app offers a proactive and customizable solution to protect users’ devices and personal safety. It combines theft deterrence, real-time alerts, and user-centric controls into one seamless experience.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to any feedback or suggestions to improve my project.
